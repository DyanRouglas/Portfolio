## Projects
This repository contains a sampling of projects and scripts that I have worked on as part of my MS in computer science and my work in research. Below is a short description of each project:

#### Machine Learning
  1. Classifying Loan Default: using a logistic regression model with L2 regularization and stochastic gradient descent built from scratch in Ruby to classify if an individual will default on a loan based on insufficient or non-existent credit history.
  2. Classifying Wildfires: using various machine learning models from sci-kit learn to classify the size of wildfires based on duration, location, and cause of the fire and to classify the cause of a fire based on the duration, location and size of a fire. 

#### Database Management
  1. Order Manager: a Relational Database Management System for managing products, product inventory, and customer information for an online store, built using Apache Derby in Java.
  
#### Scripts
  A sampling of Python, R, and MATLAB scripts, some more ad hoc in nature than others, primarily written with the purpose of analyzing, extracting, manipulating, or joining data together. Unfortunately, the data used in most of these scripts cannot be provided as it is protected by HIPAA.
